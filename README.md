# Customer Churn Prediction System

## Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction System is a Machine Learning and Streamlit-based application designed to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn (leave the service) or stay with the company.

The project uses customer subscription information such as tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and internet service details to make predictions using trained machine learning models.
